Preliminary note

Frog can be considered alpha software, and is in a fair state of flux.
Some intended functionalities are not there yet, such as a dependency
parser. These will be added very soon. Other functionalities are there, but
have not been fully tested yet, such as the multi-word chunker. More
generally, error handling and reporting is still under development.
