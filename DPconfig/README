Getting and installing Dependency Parser files for Frog.

First download the latest parser files from: 
http://ilk.uvt.nl/frog/Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz

Unpack this file into the Frog configuration directory as follows:

* Determine the location of the Frog configuration directory.  If you
  installed Frog with a package manager or as root with 'make
  install', this would typically be

  /usr/local/etc/frog 

  If you used './configure' with the '--prefix=<some-path>' option,
  the Frog configuration can be found in 

  <some-path>/etc/frog

* Double check this by checking whether this directory contains the
  file frog.cfg:

  > ls <install-path>/frog.cfg

* If you need root permission to write in <install-path>, do the
  following:

  > sudo cp Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz <install-path>
  > cd <install-path>
  > sudo tar zxf Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz

  Alternatively, if you have write permission in <install-path>,

  > cp Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz <install-path>
  > cd <install-path>
  > tar zxf Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz

* Frog will now automatically find the parser files and will run the
  dependency parser, unless this module is skipped explicitly with
  --skip=p.
