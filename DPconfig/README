Getting and Installing Dependency Parser files for Frog.

First download the latest parser files from: 
http://ilk.uvt.nl/frog/Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz

Unpack this file into the Frog configuration directory as folows:

Determine this directory. Usually that is /usr/local/etc/frog when Frog is 
installed using a package, or with 'make install'.
If you used './configure' with the '--prefix=<some-path>' option, the Frog
configuration can be found in '<some-path>/etc/frog'

use:
> ls <install-path>/frog.cfg
to check this.
   
Now unpack:	
> sudo cp Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz <install-path>
> cd <install-path>
> sudo tar zxf Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz
or:
>  tar zxf Frog.mbdp-latest.tar.gz

You must have root permissions to write into directories like /usr/local/etc/ 
so probably you must use 'sudo' go extract the tarball there.

That should be enough.
