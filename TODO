* discard -t <file> and --testdir-<dir> options.
  use Frog <options> file/port/dir instead
  file: Frog this file (wildcards too?)
  dir: Frog all files in dir
  port: run as a server
* rethink/arrange common datastructures
* Make server also support daemonizing stuff and --pid and --log
  (server now logs to terminal)
* Server logs incorrect timing (seems to count from the moment the client is accepted)
